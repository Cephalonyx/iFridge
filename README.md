# iFridge
iOS app for CP496 Final Project.


Food waste is a huge problem in Canada: "A whopping 58 percent of all food produced in Canada — 35.5 million tonnes — is lost
or wasted, according to a new report”, (​https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/food-waste-report-second-harvest-1.4981728​).

iFridge is a project that aims to reduce food waste. It is essentially a digital fridge that matches what you have
in your fridge at home and allows users to easily keep track of their food inventory. Users are notified when their food is about
to expire, and having an easy visual of all the food that they have helps to avoid unnecessarily buying food when grocery shopping.
Extra features include the ability to make your own shopping list and, time permitting, the ability to create recipe ideas based on items 
in their fridge database.
